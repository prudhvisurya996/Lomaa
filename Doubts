**Q1: How can I deploy multiple applications on a single server or separate servers?**

A1: You can deploy multiple applications on a single server or separate servers. If you use a single server, you'll need to configure server-side routing to direct incoming requests to the correct application. If you use separate servers, you can add multiple A records and IP addresses for each server.

**Q2: How can I configure subdomains in GoDaddy?**

A2: To configure subdomains in GoDaddy, create subdomains in the DNS tab, update DNS records to point to the correct server IP address, and configure server-side routing (if using a single server).

**Q3: What if I use a single server?**

A3: If you use a single server, you'll need to configure server-side routing to direct incoming requests to the correct application. You can use Nginx to create separate server blocks for each subdomain.

**Q4: What if I use multiple servers?**

A4: If you use multiple servers, you can add multiple A records and IP addresses for each server. Each subdomain will point to a specific server, and you won't need to configure server-side routing.

**Q5: Can I use a load balancer?**

A5: Yes, you can use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers. Configure the load balancer to route requests for each subdomain to the corresponding server.
